Design an encryption function, using ord() and chr() built-in functions
Design an decryption function, using chr() and ord() built-in functions
Prompt user to enter regular message and an integer key, encrypt the
message with given key.
Prompt user for encrypted message and hack the message with different cipher
key values using the decrypt function.
